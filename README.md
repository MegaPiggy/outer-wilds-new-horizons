*Do you want to create planets using New Horizons?* Then check out our [website](https://nh.outerwildsmods.com/) for all our documentation!

If you want to see examples of what NH can do check out the [examples add-on](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-new-horizons-examples) or [real solar system add-on](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-real-solar-system).

Check the ship's log for how to use your warp drive to travel between star systems!

## Incompatible mods
- Autoresume.
- Multiplayer mods like QSB and OWO. QSB actually kinda works decently as long as you don't warp.

## Features
- Load planet meshes or details from asset bundles 
- Use our [template Unity project](https://github.com/xen-42/outer-wilds-unity-template) to create assets for use in NH, including all game scripts recovered using UtinyRipper
- Separate solar system scenes accessible via wormhole OR via the ship's new warp drive feature accessible via the ship's log
- Remove existing planets
- Create planets from heightmaps/texturemaps
- Create stars, comets, asteroid belts, satellites, geysers, cloak fields
- Binary orbits
- Signalscope signals and custom frequencies
- Surface scatter: rocks, trees, etc, using in-game models, or custom ones 
- Black hole / white hole pairs 
- Custom dialogue and custom ship log entries for rumour mode and map mode
- Funnels and variable surface height (can be made of sand/water/lava/star)

## Roadmap
- Procedural terrain generation (started)
- "Quantum" planet parameters
- Better terrain and water LOD
- Edit existing planet orbits (started)
- Implement all planet features:
	- Tornados + floating islands
	- Let any star go supernova
	- Meteors
	- Pocket dimensions
	- Timed position/velocity changes
- Implement custom Nomai scrolls
- Implement custom translatable writing
